# Hosting Options for Koningschat POC

## Executive Summary

**UPDATED RECOMMENDATION:** Render for POC, AWS migration for production
**Reasoning:** pgvector compatibility is critical for our RAG system

## Company Tech Stack Analysis

### Current Standard: AWS
- ✅ **Advantages:**
  - Company expertise and knowledge
  - Production-ready infrastructure
  - Compliance with company standards
  - Scalable and enterprise-grade

- ❌ **POC Disadvantages:**
  - Complex setup (2-4 hours minimum)
  - Higher costs during development/testing
  - Requires extensive configuration
  - Slower time to market for demos

## Hosting Options Comparison

### 1. Render (UPDATED RECOMMENDATION for POC)

**Setup Time:** 20 minutes  
**Monthly Cost:** $0-7 (free tier available)  
**Complexity:** Low

**Pros:**
- ✅ **VERIFIED: pgvector support** - Critical for our RAG system
- ✅ Docker Compose native support
- ✅ PostgreSQL with extensions flexibility
- ✅ Multi-service deployments
- ✅ GitHub integration - automatic deployments
- ✅ Environment variables managed
- ✅ SSL certificates automatic
- ✅ Free tier available

**Cons:**
- ❌ Not company standard (AWS)
- ❌ Slightly more complex than Railway
- ❌ Less mature ecosystem

**Best for:** POC with pgvector requirements

### 2. Railway (DOWNGRADED - RISK IDENTIFIED)

**Setup Time:** 15 minutes  
**Monthly Cost:** $0-5  
**Complexity:** Low

**Pros:**
- ✅ Docker native
- ✅ Simple deployment process
- ✅ Good developer experience

**Cons:**
- ❌ **CRITICAL: pgvector support unverified**
- ❌ Managed PostgreSQL with limited extensions
- ❌ Risk of RAG system failure
- ❌ Not company standard

**Status:** Not recommended due to pgvector uncertainty

### 3. Supabase + Vercel (Alternative Option)

**Setup Time:** 30 minutes  
**Monthly Cost:** $0-10  
**Complexity:** Medium

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Guaranteed pgvector support** (Supabase)
- ✅ Excellent PostgreSQL management
- ✅ Vercel frontend hosting (free)

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Bun not supported** - requires Node.js migration
- ❌ Split architecture complexity
- ❌ Two platforms to manage

### 4. AWS App Runner + RDS

**Setup Time:** 2-4 hours  
**Monthly Cost:** $20-50  
**Complexity:** High

**Pros:**
- ✅ Company standard platform
- ✅ Enterprise-grade infrastructure
- ✅ Team expertise available
- ✅ Production-ready from day 1
- ✅ Full pgvector control

**Cons:**
- ❌ Complex setup for POC
- ❌ Higher costs during development
- ❌ Slower time to market

## Critical Requirements Verification

### pgvector Extension Support
**Why Critical:** Our RAG system stores 47 embeddings using pgvector for semantic search

**Verification Results:**
- ✅ **Render:** Explicitly supports PostgreSQL extensions including pgvector
- ❌ **Railway:** No documentation found, managed service limitations
- ✅ **Supabase:** Native pgvector support guaranteed
- ✅ **AWS RDS:** Full control over extensions

### Tech Stack Compatibility
- ✅ **Docker:** Render supports Docker Compose natively
- ✅ **Bun Runtime:** Render supports Bun deployments
- ✅ **Multi-service:** Backend + Database + Frontend
- ✅ **Environment Variables:** Secure secrets management

## Strategic Recommendation

### Phase 1: POC (Render)
**Timeline:** Immediate (20 minutes setup)
**Goal:** Rapid stakeholder feedback with full RAG functionality

**Benefits:**
- Guaranteed pgvector support for embeddings
- Docker Compose deployment
- Fast iteration cycles
- Low cost during testing
- Focus on product, not infrastructure

### Phase 2: Production Migration (AWS)
**Timeline:** After POC validation
**Goal:** Company compliance and production readiness

**Migration Path:**
1. Validate POC success with Render
2. Plan AWS architecture with RDS pgvector
3. Set up AWS App Runner + RDS
4. Migrate database with embeddings intact
5. Update DNS and go live

## Updated Cost Analysis

### Development Phase (3 months)
- **Render:** $0-21 total
- **Railway:** $0-15 total (but pgvector risk)
- **AWS:** $60-150 total

### Production Phase (annual)
- **Render:** $84-168/year
- **AWS:** $240-600/year (but more scalable)

## Decision Framework

**Choose Render if:**
- pgvector support is mandatory (our case)
- Need Docker Compose deployment
- Want proven PostgreSQL extensions
- Stakeholder feedback is priority

**Choose AWS if:**
- Company compliance is mandatory from day 1
- Production deployment is immediate
- Budget allows for complex setup

## Recommended Action Plan

1. **Week 1:** Deploy to Render with full RAG system
2. **Week 2-3:** Gather stakeholder feedback and iterate
3. **Week 4:** If POC successful, plan AWS migration
4. **Week 5-6:** Execute AWS migration for production

## Risk Mitigation

**Render Risks:**
- Vendor dependency → Mitigated by planned AWS migration
- Platform maturity → Acceptable for POC phase
- Team unfamiliarity → Minimal learning curve

**pgvector Risk:**
- **Railway:** High risk of RAG system failure
- **Render:** Low risk, verified support
- **AWS:** No risk, full control

## Conclusion

**UPDATED RECOMMENDATION:** Deploy to Render for POC validation, migrate to AWS for production.

**Critical Factor:** pgvector support is non-negotiable for our RAG system with 47 embeddings. Render provides verified compatibility while maintaining rapid deployment capabilities.
